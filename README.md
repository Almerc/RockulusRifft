=======

-Run Oculus Bridge to open connection to rift.

-Locate folder containing index.html and start a local server e.g. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

-Load up local host in browser and get rocking with the Rift.

-Walk into the cassettes to change tracks.

*Currently plays 30 second clips of pop genre recommendations from MixRadio.*
