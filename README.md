RockulusRifft
=============

Hack week project to make an Oculus Rift 3D environment that plays MixRadio.

This was my first and very hacky attempt at creating a 3D world for the rift using threejs.


To Play
=======

-Run Oculus Bridge to open connection to rift.

-Open Index.html

Currently doesn't play music due to it not using the public api.I'll try and get this updated soon.

Controls
========
W - forward

S - backward

A - Left straffe

D - Right straffe

Walk into the cassettes to change track.
