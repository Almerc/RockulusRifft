![Rockulus rifft](https://github.com/Almerc/RockulusRifft/blob/master/screenshots/Screenshot1.png)

Hack week project to make an Oculus Rift 3D environment that plays MixRadio.

This was my first and very hacky attempt at creating a 3D world for the rift using threejs.

To Play
=======

-Run Oculus Bridge to open connection to rift.

-Locate folder containing index.html and start a local server e.g. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

-Load up local host in browser and get rocking with the Rift.


Controls
========
W - forward

S - backward

A - Left strafe

D - Right strafe

Walk into the cassettes to change track.

If not using the rift you can look around using:

I - up

K - down

L - left

J - right

O - tilt right

U - tilt left
